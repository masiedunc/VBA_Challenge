# Overview of Project
## Purpose
This project aimed to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to improve the implementation and efficiency of the original VBA code for collecting stock information in both 2017 and 2018.  The purpose of this code is to determine which stocks may be worth investing in and can analyze an entire dataset of stocks. Even though the current focus is on stocks from Green Companies, this newly refactored code will also be able to work for larger datasets in a timely manner.  For this workbook specifically, we created two charts that compare stock information from 12 different companies using the ticker value, the total daily volume, and the yearly return.
