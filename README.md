# Overview of Project
## Purpose
This project aimed to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to improve the implementation and efficiency of the original VBA code for collecting stock information in both 2017 and 2018.  The purpose of this code is to determine which stocks may be worth investing in and can analyze an entire dataset of stocks. Even though the current focus is on stocks from Green Companies, this newly refactored code will also be able to work for larger datasets in a timely manner.  For this workbook specifically, we created two charts that compare stock information from 12 different companies using the ticker value, the total daily volume, and the yearly return.

### The Data
stock analysis of green energy company
## Results
Using my original code, I was able to achieve the desired results, yet with a run time ofâ€¦ To improve this some changes needed to be made. Before refactoring the code, I first copied the original code that set the runtime, created an input box, labeled the chart headers, added a ticker array, and activated the worksheet. I copied the rest of the code, too, yet made key changes that would help improve efficiency. As you can see in the image below, a tickerIndex and three more arrays were added before lopping through rows and running our conditionals.
